# Automated Conditions 5e: Roll Flags Guide

Applies to version: `13.5250.5`

AC5e processes Active Effects with relevant module flags. If the effect's condition evaluates to `true`, it alters the relevant roll accordingly.

> 💡 Using in console `ac5e.logEvaluationData = true` outputs the available evaluation data in console after creation. A quick way to familiarize yourselves with what is available to use!

---

## Flag Types

### `flags.automated-conditions-5e.ACTIONTYPE.MODE`

Affects **rolls made by the actor** who has an Active effect with this flag.

Short alias is also accepted: `flags.ac5e.ACTIONTYPE.MODE`.

---

### `flags.automated-conditions-5e.aura.ACTIONTYPE.MODE`

Affects **rolls made by other actors** whose token is within range of the source token.

#### Required:
- `radius=10;` — Sets the aura range in grid units.

#### Optional:
- `singleAura;` – Only one aura of the same name applies (strongest or closest).
- `includeSelf;` – Affects the aura source as well.
- `allies;` – Affects only allies of the aura source.
- `enemies;` – Affects only enemies of the aura source.
- `wallsBlock;` - Walls between the aura source and subject actor will block the aura.

If neither `allies` nor `enemies` is used, the aura affects all tokens in range.

---

### `flags.automated-conditions-5e.grants.ACTIONTYPE.MODE`

Affects **rolls made against the actor** (i.e., when the actor is the *target* of the roll).

---

## How to Use

### Step 1: Choose `ACTIONTYPE`

Replace `ACTIONTYPE` with a roll type to affect:

#### General Types:
- `all`
- `attack`
- `check`
- `damage`
- `save`

#### Specific Types:
- `concentration`
- `death`
- `initiative`
- `skill`
- `tool`
- `use` (supported for `fail`)

---

### Step 2: Choose `MODE`

Replace `MODE` with one of the following:

- `advantage` - Grants advantage
- `noAdvantage` - Suppresses advantage
- `disadvantage` - Imposes disadvantage
- `noDisadvantage` - Suppresses disadvantage
- `critical` - Forces a critical success
  - For damage flags, `addTo=<damageType>` can localize critical application to matching damage parts.
- `noCritical` - Suppresses criticals
- `fumble` - Forces a critical failure  
- `success` - Treats the roll as a success  
- `fail` - Treats the roll as a failure  
- `bonus` - Adds a numeric or calculated bonus  
  - When using `MODE = bonus`, include: `bonus=XXX;` where XXX is:
    - A fixed number (e.g., bonus=2;)
    - A formula, referencing actors via:
      - `@` or `rollingActor` - e.g., `@abilities.cha.mod` or `rollingActor.cha.mod`
      - `#` or `opponentActor` - e.g., `##attributes.spell.dc` or `opponentActor.concentration.effects.size`
      - `auraActor` - e.g., `auraActor.attributes.ac.value` for any aura related ones.
   - For damage rolls, `bonus=1d6[fire]` adds 1d6 fire damage, and `bonus=2[necrotic]` adds 2 flat necrotic damage, while `bonus=1d6` adds 1d6 damage of the same type as the relevant damage part, and `bonus=1d6[random]` adds 1d6 damage of a random type every time the roll is evaluated.
- `modifier`:
   - Adds `max` or `min` modfiers to **d20 rolls**: `modifier=(rollingActor.attributes.hp.pct > 50 ? min15 : max10)` which will roll `1d20min15` when the rolling actor's health is above 50% and `1d20max10` otherwise
   - Adds [Foundry roll modifiers](https://foundryvtt.com/article/dice-modifiers/) to **damage rolls**.
      - Use `modifier=adv` for damage _advantage_ and `modifier=dis` for _disadvantage_.
- `extraDice` - Adds or multiplies dice count on damage terms.
   - Use `bonus=Number` to add dice count, for example `bonus=2` on `1d8` -> `3d8`.
   - Use `bonus=x2` or `bonus=^2` to multiply dice count, for example `2d12` -> `4d12`.
- `diceUpgrade` - Upgrades damage dice step (`d6` -> `d8`) by the provided steps.
- `diceDowngrade` - Downgrades damage dice step (`d8` -> `d6`) by the provided steps.
- `range` - Adjusts ranged profile values and ranged-penalty behavior.
   - You can use `bonus`, `short`, `long`, `reach`.
   - You can also override ranged checks with booleans/formulas:
      - `longDisadvantage` / `noLongDisadvantage`
      - `nearbyFoeDisadvantage` / `noNearbyFoeDisadvantage`
      - `fail` / `outOfRangeFail` / `noFail` / `noOutOfRangeFail`
   - Can be expressed as `flags.automated-conditions-5e.attack.range` or granular keys such as `flags.automated-conditions-5e.range.short`.
- Special case `modifyAC` - Adds a numeric or calculated bonus to the AC of actors.
   - Include `bonus=XXX` in the effect value, following the same logic as a normal bonus to be added or subtracted from the default roll's DC.
   - Or include `set=XXX` in the effect value to **set** the AC to the specified value (number or dice roll).
   - You do not need to select an ActionType for that mode, and it will always just affect attack rolls.
   - `flags.automated-conditions-5e.modifyAC` will modify the AC of the actor it has the affect on.
   - `flags.automated-conditions-5e.grants.modifyAC` will modify the AC of the target of an attack made by the actor that has the affect on.
   - `flags.automated-conditions-5e.aura.modifyAC` will modify the AC of the actors in the radius.
   - Caveat with MidiQOL: Midi may snapshot `flags.dnd5e.targets` during `preRollAttack` and not pick up later AC5e target rewrites. Validate `modifyAC` behavior in your Midi workflow setup.
- `modifyDC`: Adds a numeric or calculated bonus to the DC of the rolled action
   - Include `bonus=XXX` in the effect value, following the same logic as a normal bonus to be added or subtracted from the default roll's DC.
   - Or include `set=XXX` in the effect value to **set** the DC to the specified value (number or dice roll).
- `criticalThreshold` - Alters the threshold for critical on d20 attack rolls.
   - `threshold=(opponentActor.creatureType.includes('dragon') ? -2 : -1)` which, when the opponent is a Dragon, will reduce the critical threshold by `2`, otherwise it is reduced by 1. If you increase the critical threshold to more than 20, you won't be able to crit :wink:
   - You can also use dice rolls, `threshold=1d4` will add the result to the critical threhold
   - Or include `set=XXX` in the effect value to **set** the critical threshold to the specified value (number or dice roll).
- `fumbleThreshold` - Alters the threshold for fumble on d20 attack rolls.
   - Same logic like the `criticalThreshold` flag above.


> 💡 For `criticalThreshold`, `fumbleThreshold`, `modifyAC` and `modifyDC` flags, you can use `set=` instead of the normal `threshold` or `bonus`, to **set** the value provided, instead of adding or subtracting from the actor values.

---


### Step 3: Add Conditions in the Effect's `value` Field

Conditions are **semicolon-separated** expressions evaluated using a dynamic "sandbox" of data relevant to the current roll.

> 💡 If **any one condition is true**, the roll is affected.

#### What Is the Evaluation Sandbox?

The sandbox contains detailed data about the actor performing the roll, potential targets, and other contextual information. This data can be referenced in condition expressions like so:

```js
rollingActor.abilities.cha.mod >= 4 &&  opponentActor.attributes.hp.pct < 50 && ['fire', 'cold'].some(type=>damageTypes[type]); opponentActor.statuses.incapacitated;
```

#### Keywords in effect's value field

| Key                    | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `itemLimited`          | Will limit the effect to rolls of the source item |
| `once`                 | Will apply the effect once |
| `usesCount=Number`     | Will limit the effect to the number of uses provided |
| `usesCount=origin`     | For actor owned items, uses from the item or activity origin of the effect will be consumed |
| `usesCount=UUID`       | For actor owned items, uses from the item or activity retrivable by the UUID will be consumed |
| `usesCount=Item.ID.Activity.ID`| `ID` can be either an `id`, `identifier` or `name`. The `Activity.ID` part is optional. If added, the uses from that activity will be consumed, otherwise from the relevant Item. |
| `usesCount=_, Number`  | If a comma separated Number is added, multiple uses will be consumed if available |
| `usesCount=ActorAttr, Number`   | Use consumable resources on the Actor instead of item/activity uses |
| | `ActorAttr` can be `hp`, `hpmax`, `hptemp`, `hd`, `hdlargest`, `hdsmallest`, `abilityXYZ` (like `str`), `senseXYZ` (like `darkvision`), `currency` (like `gp`), `spellXYZ` (like `pact` or `spell3`), `movementXYZ` (like `walk`), `exhaustion`, `inspiration`, `resources` (like `primary`, `legact` etc), or any of the actor's `flags` . |
| | For any hp `ActorAttr` which would lead to hp loss (temp or current), using `noconc` (or `noconcentration`, `noconcentrationcheck`) will disable concentration checks on that loss. |
|                        | The `Number` is optional. If omitted 1 use or relevant value will be consumed by default! |
| `optin`                | Shows the flag as an optional checkbox in the relevant roll dialog |
| `addTo=all`            | Targets all damage parts (where supported, e.g. `bonus`, `extraDice`, `diceUpgrade`, `diceDowngrade`, `critical`) |
| `addTo=fire,cold`      | Targets only matching damage types |
| `chance=Number`        | Applies only when a d100 roll is greater than or equal to the threshold |
| `name=Text`            | Custom label for tooltips/dialog opt-in entry |
| `description=Text`     | Custom opt-in description/reason text |
| `oncePerTurn` / `oncePerRound` / `oncePerCombat` | Cadence limits for usage. `cadence=turn|round|combat` aliases are supported. |
| `noProne` (and similar status keys) | Suppresses a specific status for roll automation while the effect is active |

If multiple same-action-type entries are present on the same effect, AC5e disambiguates labels automatically (for example by appending `#2`).

> When using `once` or `usesCount` and the uses are depleted, the effect will either be disabled or deleted, based on it being a transfer effect or not.

> When using comma separated Number in usesCount, the item or activity will need to have at least that Number of available uses for the effect to apply

> 💡 When using comma separated Number in usesCount, a negative value will recover uses!

> Examples:

>`usesCount=Scene.9gP78CMgo7ZmATt2.Token.B7sWVuLXxDn5v3gS.Actor.sa8PesDM1sZviqJ6.Item.42AGHJQzJZfUYxF9, 2`

> `usesCount=Item.Longsword.Activity.attack, 2` will consume two uses of the activity with the `attack` identifier from the first item that is named Longsword on the Actor that has the effect applied.

> `usesCount=Item.Longsword, Ablaze` will consume one use from an item named `Longsword, Ablaze`

>`bonus=1d6[force]; once; itemLimited; opponentActor.attributes.hp.pct < 50 && opponentActor.statuses.prone`

#### Actor Roles in the Sandbox

Depending on the type of roll, actors are categorized like this:

- **`effectActor`** - the actor that has the effect applied on.
  - Depending on the type of roll, this can be equal to `rollingActor` (attack, damage, use hooks), or `opponentActor` (checks, saves)
- **`nonEffectActor` - the actor that isn't the `effectActor` 😅 
- **`rollingActor`** – the actor performing the roll.
- **`opponentActor`** – the opposing actor (if any). For example:
  - During an **attack**, this is the target of the attack.
  - During a **saving throw**, this is the actor whose item or effect triggered the save.
    - `targetActor` for backwards compatibility only; use opponentActor instead.
- **`auraActor`** – only present if the roll is affected by an aura. Represents the aura's source.
- **`effectOriginActor`** - the actor that is the owner/source of the origin of an effect.

```

#### `statuses`
Includes token statuses like `prone`, `bloodied`, etc.

### Activity and Item Data

If the roll involves a specific action or item, you'll also have access to:

### `activity`
- `activity.name`
- `activity.activation.type` — e.g., `action`, `bonus`, `reaction`
- `activity.actionType` — e.g., `mwak`, `rsak`, `save`
- `activity.type` — item type (e.g., `spell`, `feat`)
- `activity.damageTypes` — array of damage types involved

### `item`
- `item.name`, `item.school` (for spells), etc
- `item.identifier`
- `item.properties` or `itemProperties`
- `item.type` is essentially an object that contains the basic data of the item rolled, for example: `{value: 'martialR', baseItem: 'longbow', label: 'Martial Ranged', identifier: 'Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbwepLongbow000'}`
- `itemType` is one of the following `equipment`, `feat`, `spell`, `tool`, `weapon` etc (full list in `CONFIG.Item.typeLabels`)

All these are accessible directly as paths. For example:
```text
(itemProperties.mgc && itemProperties.fin) || (itemName.Claw && damageTypes.poison)   // true if either an the roll involves a magical finesse weapon, or one named Claw and dealing poison damage
```

### Damage Types
If the activity deals specific damage types, each one is added to the sandbox:
```text
damageTypes.cold || damageTypes.fire  // true if the damage type is either cold or fire
```

### Action Types
If the activity has an action type (e.g., `mwak`, `rsak`, `save`, etc.), that is also flagged:
```text
actionType.mwak // true for Melee Weapon Attack
```
These work in combination with other flags:
```text
actionType.mwak && damageTypes.fire // true for fire-dealing melee weapon attacks
```

---

## Config and Utilities

The sandbox also exposes some config constants:
```js
CONFIG = {
  abilities, skills, tools, damageTypes, spellSchools,
  attackModes, actionTypes, itemProperties, etc.
}
```
And helpers like:
```js
checkDistance(), checkVisibility(), checkCreatureType(), checkArmor()
```

---

This sandbox gives you powerful control over **when** a specific AC5e module flags should apply, letting you create smart, level-aware, context-sensitive automation with minimal code.
